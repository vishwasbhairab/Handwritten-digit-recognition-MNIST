# 🖊️Digit Recognition using CNN

This project implements a **handwritten digit recognition system** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **MNIST dataset**. The model can classify digits (0-9) and is integrated with a **GUI for drawing digits** using Tkinter.

---
## 🚀 Features
✅ Draw a digit on the canvas and predict its value.  
✅ Displays **top prediction** with confidence percentage.  
✅ Uses a **pre-trained CNN model** for high accuracy.  
✅ Supports **real-time digit recognition** using OpenCV.  
✅ Simple GUI using **Tkinter**.

## 🖥️ How It Works
### 1. draw
1️⃣ Draw a digit on the canvas.
2️⃣ Click the **'Predict'** button.
3️⃣ The model predicts the digit and displays the **confidence score**.
4️⃣ Click **'Clear'** to redraw and try again!

### 2. webcam

1️⃣ Start the script – The webcam feed opens 📷
2️⃣ Write a digit on paper and hold it up to the camera
3️⃣ The model detects, processes, and predicts the digit 🧠
4️⃣ The digit is displayed on the screen in real-time
5️⃣ Press 'Q' to exit

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
🔹 Deploy as a **web app** using Flask or Streamlit.  
🔹 Add **image preprocessing** to improve recognition accuracy.  
🔹 Support **handwritten letters** using the EMNIST dataset.  
🔹 Implement **speech output** using `pyttsx3`.
